I was born in [Shandong Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), in February 2000. I am now a PhD student in [School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University](https://sess2.pku.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I am interested in **meteoritics, igneous petrology, mineralogy, and planetary volcanology**.

I am a researcher in Planetary Science, with a robust focus on the petrogenesis interpretations of achondrite meteorites and returned lunar samples. My expertise encompasses a broad array of disciplines including petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry. I possess adept skills in operating advanced *in-situ* instruments such as SEM-CL-EDS, EPMA, LA-ICP-MS, and am currently training in SIMS and FIB-TEM techniques. Additionally, I am proficient in using computational tools (e.g., Python, Matlab, and R) to conduct various geological simulations and calculations, such as mantle-melting modeling, phase-equilibria modeling, crystallization and assimilation modeling, and kinetic modeling based on elemental diffusion processes.

My interests also extend to integrating petrogenesis interpretations with remote sensing techniques, geophysics, seismology, and innovative machine/deep-learning approaches to broaden the understanding of planetary geology. Furthermore, I am passionate about experimental petrology, particularly in conducting crystallization experiments under controlled thermodynamic and kinetic conditions to develop reliable geo-thermobarometers and unravel the formation processes of achondrites.
