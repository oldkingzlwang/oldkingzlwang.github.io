The text in the image below is something I wrote at the end of 2017, during my final year of high school, as a way to motivate myself and reinforce my aspirations. Later that year, by chance, I ranked first in the entire school on the final exams. The school administration asked me to write something to inspire other students, so I decided to post these words as a message of encouragement.

下图中的内容是2017年底，我在读高三的时候，为了给自己加油助威而写下的有关自己理想追求的段落。后来那年的期末考试，我偶然考了全校第一名，校方让我写点东西展示在学校，以激励同学们奋斗。我便把这几段放了上去。

Looking back now, I can’t help but feel that my younger self was bold, idealistic, and perhaps a bit pretentious—reading it today definitely makes me cringe with secondhand embarrassment. But at the same time, these words truly reflect the goals and mindset I once hoped to achieve. In the end, this represents the original passion that drove me toward a career in science. So, despite the embarrassment, I choose to keep it here as a reminder—a way to hold myself accountable and stay true to the ideals I once set for myself.

以现在的眼光看，那个时候的自己年少轻狂、不知天高地厚，还有些卖弄做作之嫌，读起来令人属实倍感尴尬。但这确实是当年我实实在在希望自己能达到的那种状态。这便是我从事科学事业的初心吧——因此也不嫌羞耻地放在这里，对现在的自己也是一种鞭策。

**The meaning of the text in the image is as follows:**

> Atoms ultimately originate from the vast cosmos, and so does life. From atoms to life, both follow the same fundamental natural laws. Some of these laws exist around us, while others lie in the deepest corners of the universe. As intelligent beings, we have a responsibility to seek them with reverence, for they hold the key to the harmony between humanity and nature, and to the progress of civilization. This is why I gaze at the stars—to take on the mission of expanding the frontiers of human knowledge, to personally unravel the hidden, fascinating mysteries of the universe.
>
> Yet, we are only human. We cannot change the laws of the cosmos or command the forces of nature at will—we must remain grounded in reality. The philosopher Feng Youlan once spoke of "The Four Realms of Life"—the natural realm, the utilitarian realm, the moral realm, and the transcendent realm. I understand deeply that if I am to carry the responsibility of expanding human understanding, I must pursue the highest realm—the transcendent realm of "Heaven and Earth".
>
> To do so, I must stay grounded, which requires determination and resilience. One must possess: (1) the calmness to remain unfazed by success or failure, (2) the confidence to stand firm in uncertainty, (3) the composure to stay true to one's path despite worldly distractions, (4) the broad-mindedness to embrace diverse ideas, (5) the courage to take on challenges beyond oneself, and (6) the sense of responsibility to serve an era greater than one’s own existence.
>
> To persist unwaveringly on this sacred journey of exploration, even if the path is lonely and arduous, is to take one step closer to the spiritual sanctuary of knowledge and one step closer to the farthest reaches of human understanding.

**原文内容：**

> 仰望星空，脚踏实地。
>
> 原子最终起源于浩渺星空，生命亦复如是。从原子到生命，它们都遵循着相同的自然法则。而这些法则，有的可能就在我们身边，有的可能在宇宙极深处。作为智慧生灵，我们有责任去心存敬畏地探寻它们，因为这是人与自然求和谐、谋进步的根本奥秘之所在。所以我仰望星空，是希望以开拓人类认知的边疆为己任，亲手解开那一个个不为人知而又趣味盎然的谜团。
>
> 可我们毕竟是人类，我们不能“乘天地之正，而御六气之辩”，我们只能脚踏实地。冯友兰先生曾提到“人生四境界”——自然、功利、道德、天地。我深知，要想挑起开拓人类认知边疆的大梁，就要坚定不移地追求人生最高境界——天地境界。而要如此，就要脚踏实地，也就是要有定力、能担当。既要有宠辱不惊的平和、气定神闲的自信和与世无争的从容，又要有海纳百川的胸怀、包容天下的气概和承载时代的责任。
>
> 坚定地在“开拓”这条朝圣路上走下去，路途虽然孤独、艰难，但每走一步，我们就更接近精神的圣地；每走一步，我们就更接近人类的远方。
