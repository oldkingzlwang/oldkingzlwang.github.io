This passage from *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* below reflects Nietzsche's central philosophical ideas, especially the **Übermensch (Overman)** and **Will to Power**.

下面的这段话出自尼采的《查拉图斯特拉如是说》，体现了他“**超人哲学（Übermensch）**”和“**自主意志（Will to Power）**”的核心思想。

True growth comes when one abandons blind following and embarks on their own journey of truth. Even Zarathustra, the teacher figure, must be outgrown. -- This is what I think Nietzsche wanted to express in this chapter. I hope you will share this with me.

真正的成长在于每个人独立地去追寻真理，而不是永远依赖一个“导师”或“偶像”。追随者要超越被崇拜的对象，哪怕是“查拉图斯特拉”也不该永远被信奉。——这便是我认为尼采想要在此章节中所表达的思想。与诸君共勉。

Now I go alone, my disciples! And you too—go now, each of you, alone in your own way! That is my will.

现在我独自走了，我的弟子们！你们现在各归各独自走吧！这是我的愿望。

Truly, I advise you: leave me, resist Zarathustra! And better yet: feel ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.

确实，我奉劝你们：离开我，对查拉图斯特拉进行抵制吧！最好是：为他感到羞愧！也许他骗了你们。

One who truly knows must not only love his enemies, but also be able to hate his friends.

有认识的人必须不仅爱他的敌人，而且能恨他的朋友。

To remain a disciple forever is a poor repayment for a teacher. Why do you not tear off my laurel crown?

如果永远做个弟子，这是对老师的不好的报答。你们为什么不想扯掉我的花冠呢？

You revere me; but what if your reverence one day collapses? Beware lest a falling statue crush you!

你们尊敬我；如果有一天你们的崇拜垮掉了，那会怎么样？当心，别让一尊倒下的雕像把你们砸死！

You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what does Zarathustra matter! You are my believers—yet what are all believers!

你们说，你们信仰查拉图斯特拉？可是查拉图斯特拉算什么呢？你们是我的信徒：可是一切信徒又算什么呢！

You have not yet sought your own selves: you found me instead. Thus do all believers. And for that reason, all belief is of little worth.

你们还没有寻求过你们自己：那时你们找到我。一切信徒都是如此；因此一切信仰都没有什么意义。

Now I ask you—lose me and find yourselves. And only when you have all denied me will I return to you.

现在我要求你们，丢开我，寻求你们自己吧；等你们全都不认我，我才愿意再回到你们身边来。

Truly, my brothers, only then shall I seek those I once lost with new eyes; only then shall I love you with a new kind of love.

真的，我的弟兄们，到那时我要用另一种眼光寻找我所失去的人；那时我要用另一种爱来爱你们。
