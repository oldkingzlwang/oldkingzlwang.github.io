[The 5th Young Scientist Forum of Planetary Science](http://english.igg.cas.cn/ns/ue/202302/t20230214_327310.html) has been successfully held in Sanya City, Hainan Province, on 25-29th March 2023.

This forum is a grand event in the field of planetary science in China. There are fifteen sub-venues in various fields of planetary science at this forum, with 12 keynote speeches, 567 sub-venue presentations, and 119 poster presentations. About 1,040 scholars participated in the conference, which exceeded the scale of the first National Planetary Science Conference held in Suzhou in 2021. Therefore, it is currently the largest planetary science conference in China.

> On March 26, 2023, I delivered a session talk titled "The Slowest and Fastest Cooled Chang’e-5 Basalts".

The conference emphasized that with the successful completion of major exploration missions such as China’s first planetary science probe “Tianwen-1” reaching Mars, the Zhurong rover landing on Mars, and the Chang’E-5 mission bringing lunar samples back to Earth, China’s planetary science exploration and research has entered a new era of vigorous development.
